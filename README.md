# ALGORITHM-AND-ITS-ELEMENTS

This Algorithm reads a sentence, which ends with a point.  It takes an input sentence from the user, then obtains the length of the sentencce. 

It then loops through all the characters, checking for spaces, then vowels. 

it uses the number of spaces found to get the number of words. 

the program then prints: 

  The number of words
  The number of characters (excluding spaces)
  The number of vowels
