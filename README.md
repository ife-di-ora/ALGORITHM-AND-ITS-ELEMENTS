# ALGORITHM-AND-ITS-ELEMENTS

This Algorithm reads a sentence, which ends with a point.  To obtain the lenght of the sentencce , It takes an input sentence from the user, then loops through all characters  the input until it gets to a full stop. 

Then again, it loops through all the characters, checking for spaces, then vowels. 

it uses the number of spaces found to get the number of words. 

the program then prints: 

  The number of words
  The number of characters (excluding spaces)
  The number of vowels
